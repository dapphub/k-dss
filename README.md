This repo contains the formal specification and verification of [multicollateral dai](https://github.com/makerdao/dss).

The behavior of the contracts is specified in a literate format at [dss.md](src/dss.md), which generates a series of reachability claims, defining `succeeding` and `reverting` behavior for each function of each contract. These reachability claims are then tested against the [formal semantics of the EVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) using the [klab](https://github.com/dapphub/klab) tool for interactive proof inspection and debugging.

An html version of the specification, together with links to in-browser symbolic execution previews, is available at [stablecoin.technology](http://stablecoin.technology/)

# Installation
## dependencies
* klab. Installation instructions can be found at [klab](https://github.com/dapphub/klab).

## build
```sh
git clone git@github.com:dapphub/k-dss.git
make
```

This will download and build the target contracts in `dss/`, and compile the literate specifications in `src/` to K specifications, saving the results in `out/specs`.

# Usage

To run a proof with [klab](https://github.com/dapphub/klab), you'll need to have a `klab server` running. Then try:
```sh
klab run --spec out/specs/proof-Vat_dai_succ.k
```

This will open an interactive `klab` session exploring the success behaviour of the `dai()` method of the contract `Vat`.

It's also possible to check the behaviours non-interactively, directly using `kprove`, which is much faster. To check all behaviours of the `Vat` contract, executing 4 jobs in parallel:
```sh
make proofs-Vat -j4
```

Specific behaviours can also be checked, for example:
```sh
make out/specs/proof-Vat_dai_succ.k.proof.timestamp
```

# Progress

(proof CI running at [dapp.ci](https://dapp.ci) )

`x` - the proof is succeeding

`?` - expected to succeed but yet to be checked

`o` - in development (ask before attacking)

`-` - no fail behaviour

```

# Documentation

To build the literate specification in HTML, run `make doc`. The output of this process is available at [stablecoin.technology](http://stablecoin.technology/)

## specification format
The format used in [dss.md](src/dss.md) provides a concise way of specifying the behavior of a contract method (see [act-mode](https://github.com/livnev/act-mode) for a simple emacs major mode for `.act` specs).

Let's break down the specification of the behavior of the function `heal` in the contract `Vat`:
```act
behaviour heal of Vat
interface heal(bytes32 u, bytes32 v, int256 rad)

types

    Can   : uint256
    Dai_v : uint256
    Sin_u : uint256
    Debt  : uint256
    Vice  : uint256

storage

    #Vat.wards(CALLER_ID) |-> Can
    #Vat.dai(v)           |-> Dai_v => Dai_v - rad
    #Vat.sin(u)           |-> Sin_u => Sin_u - rad
    #Vat.debt             |-> Debt  => Debt - rad
    #Vat.vice             |-> Vice  => Vice - rad

iff

    Can == 1

iff in range uint256

    Dai_v - rad
    Sin_u - rad
    Debt - rad
    Vice - rad
```
This snippet of code will generate two reachability claims, `proof-Vat_heal_succ.k` and `proof-Vat_heal_fail.k`. Both of these claims will refer to the bytecode of the contract `Vat` and use the function signature of `heal(bytes32,bytes32,int256)` as the first 4 bytes of calldata (keeping the rest of the calldata abstract). In the `success` spec, the conditions under the `iff` headers are postulated, while in the `fail` spec their negation is.

The interesting part of this particular function happens under the `storage` header. The meaning of the line:
`#Vat.dai(v)           |-> Dai_v => Dai_v - rad`
is that in the `success` case, the value at the storage location which we call `#Vat.dai(v)` will be updated from `Dai_v` to `Dai_v - rad`.

To prove this reachability claim, the k prover explores all possible execution paths starting from the precondition (whats on the left hand side of a `=>`) and the claim is proven if they all end in a state satisfying the postcondition (right hand side of the `=>`).

More information about how the K prover and the K Framework in general works can be found at [Semantics-Based Program Verifiers for All Languages](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/FSL/papers/2016/stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla/stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla-public.pdf) and a detailed description of the semantics of EVM defined in K is given in [KEVM: A Complete Semantics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/97207).
