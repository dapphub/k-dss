K-DSS: K Specification of Multi-Collateral Dai
==============================================

This repo contains the formal specification and verification of [multicollateral dai](https://github.com/makerdao/dss).
The behavior of the contracts is specified in a literate format at [dss.md](src/dss.md), which generates a series of reachability claims defining `succeeding` and `reverting` behavior for each function of each contract.
These reachability claims are then tested against [KEVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics).

Installation and Running
------------------------

### Setup Solidity Compiler and Dapp Tools

First you'll need to install the [Nix packager](https://nixos.org/download.html).

```sh
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

Then you can install the Solidity compiler:

```sh
nix-env -f https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/archive/master.tar.gz -iA solc-static-versions
```

And finally, install the [DappHub toolkit](https://dapp.tools/).

```sh
curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh
```

### Setup KLab and KEVM

*Using external install of KLab/KEVM*:

-   Follow the install instructions of [KLab](https://github.com/makerdao/klab), including following the instructions for setting up KEVM included there.
-   Make sure that the `bin` directory inside the KLab repo is on `PATH` here.
-   Make sure that `KLAB_EVMS_PATH` is set as instructed if you are building KEVM from source (not needed if installed from package).

*From-source builds in submodule*:

If you want to build KEVM and KLab from source, you can:

-   Install the system dependencies of [KEVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) and of [KLab](https://github.com/makerdao/klab).
-   Make sure that `PATH` is setup to include `$(pwd)/deps/klab/bin`.
-   Make sure that `KLAB_EVMS_PATH` is setup to include `$(pwd)/deps/evm-semantics`.
-   Run the following:

    ```sh
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    touch include.mak
    make klab dapp
    make include.mak -B
    make kevm -j3
    ```

### Running the Proofs

To run all the proofs, you can use the `prove` target in the `Makefile`:

```sh
make prove -j8
```

You can optionally override the `KLAB` variable to set timeouts on each proof:

```sh
make prove -j12 KLAB='timeout 300 klab'
```

A common strategy is to run with a small timeout first, and then a much larger timeout:

```sh
make prove -j12 -k KLAB='timeout 300 klab'
make prove -j8     KLAB='timeout 7200 klab'
```

Make sure to adjust the parallelism (`-jNNN`) option as appropriate for the running machine.

### Running Individual Proofs

You may use the `Makefile` to do several things (for a given proof `SPEC`):

-   `make out/built/SPEC`: Prove any dependencies of `SPEC` and then construct the specification for `SPEC`.
-   `make out/accept/SPEC`: Additionally prove the specification `SPEC` itself.
-   `make out/gas/SPEC.raw`: Additionally extract a pretty-formatted string with the `<gas>` expression for `SPEC`.
-   `make out/accept/SPEC.dump`: Prove `SPEC` (after dependencies) and dump data needed for KLab debugger.
-   `make SPEC.klab-view`: Open the proof of `SPEC` in the [KLab debugger](https://github.com/makerdao/klab), assumes you have already dumped needed debug data.

### ACT Specification Format

The format used in [dss.md](src/dss.md) provides a concise way of specifying the behavior of a contract method.
See [act-mode](https://github.com/livnev/act-mode) for a simple emacs major mode for `.act` specs.

Let's break down the specification of the behavior of the function `heal` in the contract `Vat`:

```act
behaviour heal of Vat
interface heal(bytes32 u, bytes32 v, int256 rad)

types

    Can   : uint256
    Dai_v : uint256
    Sin_u : uint256
    Debt  : uint256
    Vice  : uint256

storage

    #Vat.wards(CALLER_ID) |-> Can
    #Vat.dai(v)           |-> Dai_v => Dai_v - rad
    #Vat.sin(u)           |-> Sin_u => Sin_u - rad
    #Vat.debt             |-> Debt  => Debt - rad
    #Vat.vice             |-> Vice  => Vice - rad

iff

    Can == 1

iff in range uint256

    Dai_v - rad
    Sin_u - rad
    Debt - rad
    Vice - rad
```

This snippet of code will generate two reachability claims, `Vat_heal_succ_pass_rough.k` and `Vat_heal_fail_rough.k`.
Both of these claims will refer to the bytecode of the contract `Vat` and use the function signature of `heal(bytes32,bytes32,int256)` as the first 4 bytes of calldata (keeping the rest of the calldata abstract).
In the `success` spec, the conditions under the `iff` headers are postulated, while in the `fail` spec their negation is.

The interesting part of this particular function happens under the `storage` header.
The meaning of the line `#Vat.dai(v) |-> Dai_v => Dai_v - rad` is that in the `success` case, the value at the storage location which we call `#Vat.dai(v)` will be updated from `Dai_v` to `Dai_v - rad`.

To prove this reachability claim, the K prover explores all possible execution paths starting from the precondition (whats on the left hand side of a `=>`) and the claim is proven if they all end in a state satisfying the postcondition (right hand side of the `=>`).

More information about how the K prover and the K Framework in general works can be found at [Semantics-Based Program Verifiers for All Languages](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/FSL/papers/2016/stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla/stefanescu-park-yuwen-li-rosu-2016-oopsla-public.pdf).
A detailed description of the semantics of EVM defined in K is given in [KEVM: A Complete Semantics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/97207).
